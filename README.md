## Data Set Information:

Predicted Attribute: Localization site of protein. ( non-numeric ). 

The references below describe a predecessor to this dataset and its development. They also give results (not cross-validated) for classification by a rule-based expert system with that version of the dataset.

## Attribute Information:

1. Sequence Name: Accession number for the SWISS-PROT database 
2. mcg: McGeoch's method for signal sequence recognition. 
3. gvh: von Heijne's method for signal sequence recognition. 
4. alm: Score of the ALOM membrane spanning region prediction program. 
5. mit: Score of discriminant analysis of the amino acid content of the N-terminal region (20 residues long) of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins. 
6. erl: Presence of "HDEL" substring (thought to act as a signal for retention in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen). Binary attribute. 
7. pox: Peroxisomal targeting signal in the C-terminus. 
8. vac: Score of discriminant analysis of the amino acid content of vacuolar and extracellular proteins. 
9. nuc: Score of discriminant analysis of nuclear localization signals of nuclear and non-nuclear proteins.
